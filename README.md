How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Each user need can be translated either into a single or set of user stories. User stories are atomic features that either satisfy a user need on their own, or come together as separate components to fully create a features. 
User stories allow the developers on a scrum team to work on small parts of the project, without having to worry about how each piece comes together for the complete project.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I prefer to develop programs from the top down. I start by looking at the end product, and break it up into separate components to work on individually. Then, by developing each component, the end product slowly comes together.
The main Agile process I hope to incorporate into my future development work is continuous feedback. The world moves much faster in this day and age, and being able to stay in contact with the customer and adapt to new requests, as well as responding to user stories that were not designed correctly are important to avoid wasting time and effort.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

The three main values of a good team member in software development are transparancy, adaptability, and responsiveness. Each team member should be transparent about the work they have and have not completed at each stand-up meeting. Adaptability is a key feature of an agile approach, allowing teams to quickly pivot when required by either the customer
or issues with user stories. Responsiveness means reacting to any issues rapidly and resolving them as soon as possible to ensure that development is not impeded.
